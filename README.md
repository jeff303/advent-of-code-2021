# Jeff Evans Advent of Code 2021

In Clojure, obviously.

## Usage

Install the newest version of Clojure with command lien tools.

Run the project's tests (this includes all days finished so far).

    $ clojure -T:build test

Note: due to [this](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081), I removed my custom input files
from this repo, although the test still expects them at a certain path.  Files should be named `day1.txt`,
`day2.txt`, etc. and live under `resources/input`.  You will also have to update the expected values in the assertions
if plugging in different ones, of course.
